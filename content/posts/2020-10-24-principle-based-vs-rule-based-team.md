# Background

Every teams have their ways of working those define procedures, processes how people collectively solve the common problem, and achieve team goals. As we are living in a changing environment, processes are also required to adapt and evolve as well. Principle-based and Rule-based are the 2 “opposite” approaches that help to capture Teams’ ways of working. This article is trying to emphasize the advantages of the principle-based team and explain why all teams can earn benefits from building common guiding principles.

# Principle-based and Rule-based concepts

The 2 concepts come from corporate governance, with the key differences are rules quantity and how they enforce day-to-day operations. In general terms, Principle-based approach means relying on high-level, broadly stated Principles rather than detailed, prescriptive rules.

While rule-based approach strictly requires people to follow descriptive processes, practices,  principle-based approach is more outcome-oriented. So, it delegates process decisions to people who are closest to works and only require acceptable outcomes.

# Why moving to Principle-based approach

Principle-based approach is more adaptive to changes. As it is broadly stated, it can be applied flexibility in different circumstances. In complex environment, new scenarios that are not covered in defined rules can arise anytime. That causes the rule-based approach to become harder to stay up to date.

Besides, principles-based approach comes in a concise format that is easier to circulate in teams. So, members will not get lost in a huge number of rules. Simplicity is reinforced by principles and help the team reduce the complexity of compliance. This way also promotes conversations between members to be on the same page about principle application.

Finally, principles with outcome-oriented naturally empower people to take ownership. As the doers are always at a better place to make decisions, high-level managers should step back, only set expectations, and facilitate teams to do what they do best. 

# How to adopt 

We do not need to break the rules system to adopt principles and the two can even co-operate well with each other. We can still follow defined rules in day-to-day activities and gradually figure out principles that fit the team. Then, based on the guiding principles, tailoring rules can help the team further to perfecting ways of working.

Importantly, senior management needs to be more closely involved in shaping principles for the organization’s wide, not only team level. Forming principles at the team level will not work without organization support. The organization must be confident enough with their personnel to allow them to make solid decisions based on particular situations.

Then, with both the bottom-up and top-down buy-in, principles can be established and facilitated people to do the right things and help the whole teams, organization moving on the right track.
