It is my concern when running a couple of Teams/ Projects in my current company. We call our customized way of working “Scrum” but with much more internal processes need to be followed. Then, I feel like the traditional bureaucracy is dominating Agile/ Scrum core values at a certain level that brings a question: are we doing Agile/ Scrum or not at all?

As a Project Manager, I still need to ensure that my project way of working complies with Company standards. And as an Agile Practitioner, I am aware that underlying those standard processes, the Agile mindset, principles are more important to support how the team, people make the right decisions. And making more right decision bring more value to customers, satisfying the team and company itself.

Then, to answer the question is your project Agile, we should answer whether we have built a common mindset and principles as a foundation for team and people to make more right decisions. Agile manifesto with 4 core values is a good start for everyone to begin with a short and easy to remember guidance. Then, whenever an important decision is about to be made, the team should reflect on those mantras and understand why that decision is made that way. After a while, the common foundation is reinforced by the team and they share the same understanding, believes to move forward. 

Process, on the other hand, should be more flexible and adapting to the nature of each project. It should also be tailored by the team gradually based on team common principles. The adjustment should be from small steps for everyone to follow easily and understand why it is happening like that. It should not be a big bang change such as overriding traditional processes to follow a new agile one. It is more like building a common sense among teammates and the team itself will make decisions throughout its journey. 

In summary, to answer the question is your team/ project agile, we should figure out whether the team has built a solid foundation to make decisions as a team; whether the team has a common sense, shared believes, principles, when interacting with each other and external stakeholders in day to day work. And again, any traditional processes or applied frameworks do not stop us to be agile. We can start from that point and continue to improve from it with more right decisions made by the team.
