# Context

When we start with a small Agile team, things are easy to communicate. People are usually understanding their teammates better and they can easily know who is doing what. It is also comfortable to gather the whole team and go through all of the works being done. There are rooms for everyone to raise their concerns and seeking advice from all other members.

Things will become tricky when the team size is increased. With the larger number of communication channels, information can easily get lost and gaps in knowledge and understanding emerge. This article is trying to help how we structure a medium-sized team (from 12 to 50 members)

# Problem refinement

What are the true pain points of a medium-sized team (comparing with a small agile team):

* Members might be overwhelming with too many communication channels.
* Team meetings might take longer and ineffective with less space for individuals to speak.
* Day-to-day activities require more overhead discussion and information might still get lost.

# Ideation

What are the potential actions to consider in this situation:

* Re-structure to component sub-teams.
* Re-structure to feature sub-teams.
* Re-structure to functional sub-teams.
* Keep the whole team but do differently with all meetings/ team events.

# My Journey

In one of my medium-sized team with 20 members, we are using the hybrid approach of those 4 basic strategies. It means that we still keep the team as 1 single entity and mixing with “sub-teams” based on product features, system components & members’ specialties. This is not a clear split into “sub-teams” but smaller groups focusing on specific topics. It helps each member to have 3 specific channels to raise their voices with relevant teammates only. That minimizes overhead discussion and helps each member to stay focus on relevant topics.

At the whole team level, we only keep 2 events: Iteration Planning and Retrospective (organize back to back in a half of a day when transiting from 1 former to later Iteration). We keep the 2 meetings at the whole team level to allow people to start and end each Iteration with the big picture. Everyone should be aware of the Iteration goals before getting starts. Then, people can make better decisions in day to day works to meet the Iteration goals. Later, the whole team retrospects the Iteration together to decide on what can be done differently (including the way we structure team).

During the iteration, we let people self-organize their works and proactively collaborate with “their sub-teams” for day to day works. Besides, the Cross team sync with representatives of all sub-teams is an event to deal with dependencies and changes on the way. Representatives of sub-teams usually are leads or seniors of their specialties with sufficient knowledge about all components and features. They can make decisions based on the latest information on the way then communicate with their sub-teams more efficiently. 

# Conclusion

There is no ultimate answer to an ideal team structure. The team can consider the 4 basic strategies and discover its own structure that works. It should be tailored for the team based on actual needs and through continuous experiments. Team structure can also evolve to adapt to business needs and changes from the surrounding environment.
