Product owner is the key role to lead agile/ scrum teams to success that brings value to customers. It is also a very challenging responsibility and sometimes, product owners might be off track. The 6 product owner anti-patterns are analyzed with symptoms, root causes, and potential solutions to handle the situations. Hopefully, this will help to prevent all POs from falling to bad examples.

# Emotional Decision Making

It is not bad to make decisions with some sort of emotional factor but if PO overuse this, agile team might be left with skepticism. As agile team is deserved to understand the why behind their daily works, decisions which are only based on PO's emotions/ feelings are harder to be understood by the team. This leads to a barrier inside the team and negative consequences in the long run. The reason behind this might be sometimes clear data are hard to acquire (or share if it is sensitive). PO might need to decide based on multiple assumptions or owned sense with pressure from business stakeholders. Then, agile team might feel those decisions are irrational or doubt the outcome. 

Potential solution in this circumstance could be scrum master/ agile team should seek the WHY behind PO's decision. Empathy is important to really understand PO or end-users' real needs. Based on that, the WHAT needs to be built question can be gradually answered and adapted from small feedback loop cycles. In case decisions need to be made without much data in hand, Team & PO can consider to use Qualitative prioritization techniques likes MoSCoW, Kano, Stacked Ranking... If a decision is related to HOW to build something or needed timeline, it should be based on team's evaluation. Impact or risk analysis could be used if external factors influence team decision-making process too much.

# Too Easy-going

This implies the anti-pattern that PO is not good at negotiation with team and easily accepts the imperfection of product. Gradually, product is built with a lot of inconvenience and limitations to deliver the highest value to end-users. It also discourages Agile team to grow to overcome healthy challenges. Root cause of this might be PO's character or being unconfident to deal with more experience team members. It is obviously difficult for a new PO joining the team with much more accumulative product knowledge and technical expertise. It is also challenge for an old PO with a team staying in their comfort zone for long time. 

Potential solution is keeping track of historical data like velocity, earned value management, burndown/ burn-up charts... That helps to visualize team actual delivery to all internal and external stakeholders. It also stimulates improvements as team clearly understands where they are and easier to set the next possible goal.

# Over Micro-management

Primary goal of PO is maximizing business values to end-users, not keeping people busy in daily works. It is counter-productive if PO is only focusing on each individual task progress and HOW the tasks are being done. This might be due to an environment lacking Trust or legacy from traditional working mindset, methodology. It is easier to just looking at single task is being done and continuously assigning tasks to keep everyone busy (from the surface). 

In this circumstance, trust and collaborative environment should be gradually built up. Value to end-user should be the main focus and Scrum team (with Scrum master's guidance) should always seek end-user feedback as early as possible. Team should understand how all individual tasks will be integrated and be recieved by end-users to know what could be the best approach. It also brings more chances to get PO buy-in to the Way of working transformation.

# Lack of Vision

High-level vision and medium-term roadmap are essential for the team to be engaged and better prepared. It is PO's responsibility to build up product vision and roadmap that is sufficient for release planning and architectural design, decisions from the team (in the most effective way). Lack of vision, roadmap might lead to lower team performance; high risk, cost of reworks in the long run. The reason behind this symptom might be PO is lacking in-depth domain knowledge to build up and maintain product vision, roadmap. Especially if the product eco-system is not well defined, structured, single product roadmap will depend on multiple other products. The complexity increases exponentially when multiple business stakeholders influence the product design and development that excesses PO's management capability. 

Solution for this is always starting with an initial vision, roadmap. No matter how BAD it is, keep it transparent and give all internal and external stakeholders to contribute feedbacks, challenges. Gradually, building a cadence and mechanism to tailor and adjust it on the way. Try to focus on the short term value first to get feedback from needed stakeholder on an actual small chunk of deliverables. Upcoming and longer-term plan is built up from that when all needed stakeholders have a habit to review and adjust a product roadmap.
